## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

The main objective of this project is to develop an understanding of the challenges that must be addressed for a real-time implementation of a computing system operating in a form factor-constrained environment. 

The project description is available in the project [document](doc/3dy4-project-2024.pdf). The constraints for different modes of operation (i.e., custom sample rates) are available [here](doc/3dy4-constraints-group-65.pdf).
